## Projects

### UNB Cybersec
I am the **former** Training Coordinator for the [UNB Cybersecurity Club](https://unbcybersec.com/), where I develop and present training material for many hacking topics, including web security, reverse engineering, cryptography, and forensics.

### OpenMod
I **used to** actively contribute to the [OpenMod plugin framework for .NET](https://github.com/openmod/OpenMod/).

### Unturned Plugins
I **no longer** develop free plugins for the game Unturned, primarily using OpenMod. I no longer am taking paid commissions. If you have a question, contact me through [the OpenMod Discord server](https://discord.gg/B2D48rc).

Dang, it sounds like I need a project. If you have something cool, let me know.
